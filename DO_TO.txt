MY LOG:
1. Remove folders:
    - dist - distrubution folder with EGG file (lib file)
    - build  - I assume build egg file
    - dist x86
TO do:
- what those file are doing:
    - convert log file to..
    - calc confidence
- Closed: run with sparce and prude flags
    - status: this is default
1- how to compare results. run to similar run, look for different
    - Generate result in article
    - use get result_from_log.py
2- Go through core.py - trank, prune ---
3. - plot histogram  -expecting alexnet.numpy ?  need to debug



Run imagenet with resnet50:
    # This script launches ResNet50 inference benchmark in FP32 on 1 GPU with 128 batch size
        python ./main.py -j5 --arch resnet50 -b 128 --benchmark-inference /data/imagenet

check usage:
        SparseSpeedupBench
        prune_rate = masking.name2prune_rate[name]
